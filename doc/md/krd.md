## Description

Calculates the Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance between a collection of `jplace` samples. The command is a re-implementation of [`guppy kr`](http://matsen.github.io/pplacer/generated_rst/guppy_kr.html), see there for more details.

## Details

The command reads in the `jplace` samples and calculates their pairwise KR distances. The result is printed to a symmetrical matrix by default, but can also be printed as a list or an upper triangular matrix.
